# TestWalk

These directories are each used as a rootDir in one or more tests of the `Walk` function.
Some rootDirs referenced in the tests are not present in this directory, because Git
cannot track empty directories.  Those directories will be created by the tests that require them.

Test Folders:
- empty (Untracked)
- emptyFolder (Untracked)
- flat
- folderInFolder
- tree
